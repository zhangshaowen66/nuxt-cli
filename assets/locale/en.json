    "可以实现基于UTXO安全模型的智能合约": "Can be based on UTXO Smart contract for security model",
    "特点": "Characteristics",
    "主要特点有：比特币网络是目前最大的一个区块链技术的生态系统，以太坊第一次将智能合约的概念从理论变成实际，拓展了区块链技术的边界。SLU从设计之初就充分考虑了兼容性，在SLU上拥有比特币所有特性，基于EVM的智能合约可以直接在SLU上部署运行。与比特币和以太坊采用POW机制挖矿不一样，SLU提出了SILKWORM共识机制。SILKWORM在POS基础上进行了创新：": "The main features are: Bitcoin network is currently the largest ecosystem of blockchain technology. For the first time, Ethereum has changed the concept of smart contract from theory to reality and expanded the boundaries of blockchain technology. SLU has fully considered compatibility since its inception, and has all the features of Bitcoin on the SLU. EVM-based smart contracts can be deployed directly on the SLU. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum using the POW mechanism to mine, SLU proposed the SILKWORM consensus mechanism. SILKWORM has been innovated on the basis of POS:",
    "以用户持有的UTXO进行挖矿，UTXO不论大小都有机会获得挖矿资格，这种方式大大减小了POW机制下的能源浪费；": "Mining with UTXO held by users, UTXO has the opportunity to obtain mining qualification regardless of size, which greatly reduces energy waste under the POW mechanism;",
    "区块打包成功后，矿工会获得区块内所有交易的手续费，另外获得1SLU区块奖励，手续费和区块奖励会分5次发放，第1次及时发放，后4次在后续101-104个区块发放，这种方式提高了潜在攻击者的成本，降低了安全隐患；": "After the block is successfully packaged, the mine union will receive the handling fee for all transactions in the block, and the 1SLU block reward will be awarded. The handling fee and block reward will be distributed in 5 times, the first time in time, and the next 4 times in the subsequent 101- 104 blocks are issued, which increases the cost of potential attackers and reduces security risks;",
    "UTXO": "When UTXO is eligible for block packaging, SLU will determine whether the holding period is more than 30 days. If it exceeds 0.58% monthly interest payment, but no more than 360 days, this method encourages SLU holders to be online and receive rewards. The more nodes, the more stable and secure the SLU.",
    "创新": "Innovation",
    "区块链除了具备价值传递的功能外，其去中心化、不可篡改的等特性更能解决在实体经济具体场景一些痛点，SLU的区块大小增至8M，数据直接上链1024B，智能合约承载最大量32M，并发明了数据上链协议SILKSCREEN：": "In addition to the function of value transfer, the blockchain's decentralized and non-tamperable features can solve some pain points in the specific scene of the real economy. The block size of SLU is increased to 8M, and the data is directly uplinked to 1024B. The maximum amount of 32M, and invented the data uplink protocol SILKSCREEN:",

    "SLU": "SLU designed a low transaction cost mechanism. SLU direct transfer is calculated according to the transfer amount ratio of 0.00005%-0.00001%. The larger the transaction volume, the lower the rate, and the minimum value is 0.0001 SLU, and the maximum value is 0.5 SLU. The smart contract call is free, the send operation consumes a small amount of GAS, and the lowest GAS price is 0.00000010 SLU."
